ArtMerge
========

This app merges images from artists from Google into a new image.
This app is a blue print. It does nothing more than create the outlines for a process.
All resulting images are (probably) unique. They are made by the internet, they have no copyrights.
Artist names are randomly taken from an artist name api.
Then Google Images is requested to find images with this name.
When we have a result, three images are picked and combined together into a new image.
