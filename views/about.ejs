        <p>iMerge is all about image merging. iMerge is greatly inspired by the work called ZAP,
            Zapped Artificial Picture, by <a href="http://apfab.com/">apfab</a>. iMerge
            has several improvements, IMHO: no user interaction needed. iMerge contacts several
            API's all by itself. By visiting the site, you kick off quite a process, that's why
            it takes some time before the first image is shown.
        </p>
        <p>
            iMerge merges images of artist's works into something new, something fresh, some
            refreshment of their work. I hardly have a hand in the resulting mix: the programming
            code is the blueprint, the web the source.
